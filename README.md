Welcome to WorkTrack!
Keep track of your work sessions. Here's how it works.

WORK TIME:
Enter the length of your work session. Tap the button to set a default value of 8 hours.

CLOCK IN:
Enter the clock in time. Tap the button to insert the current time.

BREAK MIN:
Enter the expected length of your break. Tap the button to set a default value of 30 minutes.

BREAK DONE:
Check this box when your break is complete. The break duration will be used instead of the Break Min value to calculate Clock Out and Time Left.

BREAK START:
Enter the start time of your break. Tap the button to insert the current time.

BREAK END:
Enter the end time of your break. Tap the button to insert the current time.

CLR:
Clear the current session data.

DATE/TIME:
Displays the current date (day-month) and time.

END:
End the work session early. Work Time will be updated to reflect the actual time worked.

LOGDEL:
Clear the app’s history of previous sessions.

GETLOG:
Download a log file containing the history of work sessions. To upload a log file into the memory, press and hold for 3 seconds.

TIME LEFT:
When it reaches zero, the value will blink, and a sound alarm will play. Tap the button to stop the blinking and alarm and continue working overtime.

CLOCK OUT:  
When Time Left reaches zero, Clock Out and Work Time will update every second to track overtime work. Tap the Clock Out button to stop the calculation and end the session. You will be prompted to save the session data. You can save the data immediately or decline the prompt to modify the Clock Out value before saving. If you modify the Clock Out value, the Work Time value in the log file will be adjusted accordingly. Tap the Clock Out button again to save the data after modifying the Clock Out value.

Happy work sessions!
